--PROJECT EXPLANATION: This project was built to create a data source for my Tableau project while also displaying some of my querying abilities in SQl.
--This project investigates trends in marriages and divorces, as rates (out of 1000 people), in total amounts, and as a ratio between marriages and divorces.
--Initial Data Exploration
	--Select entire marriage rate table
Select * FROM [dbo].[marriage_rate]
	--Number of Countries/Entities in Marriage table
Select COUNT(Entity) FROM [dbo].[marriage_rate]
	--Average Marriage Rate
Select AVG([Crude marriage rate (per 1,000 inhabitants)]) FROM [dbo].[marriage_rate]
	--Select entrie Divorce rate table
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[divorce_rate]
	--Number of Countries/Entities in Divorce table
SELECT COUNT(Entity) FROM [dbo].[divorce_rate]
	--Average Divorce Rate[dbo].[divorce_rate]
SELECT AVG([Crude divorce rate (per 1,000 inhabitants)]) FROM [dbo].[divorce_rate]
	--Entire Population Table
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[population$]

	--Search for US stats
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[marriage_rate]
WHERE Entity like '%state%'
SELECT AVG([Crude marriage rate (per 1,000 inhabitants)]) FROM [dbo].[marriage_rate]
WHERE Entity like '%state%'
	--Search for UK stats
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[marriage_rate]
WHERE Entity like '%united kingdom%'

-- Check for world or continent values (Don't want to be double-counting things later on)
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[marriage_rate]
WHERE Entity Like '%World%' OR Entity Like '%Europe%' OR Entity Like '%Asia%' OR Entity Like '%Africa%'
	-- Some redundant values discovered, but their "Code" was always NULL. 
	--Verifying ability to filter out redundant values by "NULL code" by first finding all entities whose code is NULL
SELECT Entity, MAX([Crude marriage rate (per 1,000 inhabitants)]) as 'Max Marriage Rate' 
	FROM [dbo].[marriage_rate]
	WHERE Code is NULL
	GROUP BY Entity
	--Double check the divorce table null codes
SELECT Entity, MAX([Crude divorce rate (per 1,000 inhabitants)]) as 'Max Divorce Rate' 
	FROM [dbo].[divorce_rate]
	WHERE Code is NULL
	GROUP BY Entity

--Find the year with most recent data for each country, then store it in a temp table for future reference
SELECT Entity, MAX([Year]) AS 'MaxYear'
	INTO #temp
	FROM [dbo].[marriage_rate] 
	GROUP BY Entity
	ORDER BY Entity

SELECT * FROM #temp
	ORDER BY Entity
--Use the temp table to find the most recent marriage rates for each entity, sorted by marriage rate
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[marriage_rate] T1
	JOIN #temp
	ON (T1.Entity = #temp.Entity AND T1.[Year] = #temp.MaxYear)
	ORDER BY [Crude marriage rate (per 1,000 inhabitants)] desc

--While finding the most recent marriage rates by country, I found duplicates in my results. 
--I used these 2 queries to verify that the data had been doubled in the original table, which I further verified in the Excel file.
--I then used them to verify that the problem had been fixed after I made a disctinct copy of the table, removing the duplicates.
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[marriage_rate]
	WHERE Entity = 'Antigua and Barbuda' AND [Year] = 1995

	--Repeat the 2nd test on the cleaned up Divorce Table, and on the original Population table 
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[divorce_rate]
	ORDER BY Entity, [YEAR]

SELECT * FROM [dbo].[population$]
	ORDER BY Entity, [YEAR]
